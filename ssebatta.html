<h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Project Ideation</h3>
<p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
From the very beginning, I actively participated in shaping the idea of this project, driven by my passion for technology and innovation in agriculture. I strongly advocated for the development of a mobile application integrated with machine learning, believing that such a solution would provide farmers with an efficient and accessible tool for early detection and diagnosis of Fall Armyworm (FAW) infestations. Recognizing the challenges faced by farmers in identifying and managing FAW, I pushed for a technology-driven approach that could leverage data and AI to offer accurate pest detection. My goal was to ensure that the project not only focused on research but also led to the creation of a practical and impactful solution that farmers could easily use in the field.

<h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Field Data Collection</h3>
<p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
As part of the research team, I actively participated in the data collection process, ensuring that we gathered accurate and relevant information for the project. I visited NARO (National Agricultural Research Organization) and engaged with experts to understand the extent of Fall Armyworm (FAW) infestations and the current strategies being used to combat them. Additionally, I went into the field, visiting different farmers to document their experiences, challenges, and pest management practices. By conducting interviews and surveys, I helped collect valuable insights that would later shape the development of our machine learning-based mobile application. This hands-on experience gave me a deeper understanding of the real-world impact of FAW and reinforced the importance of developing technology-driven solutions tailored to farmers' needs.

<h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Weather API Integration and Pest Advisory</h3>
<p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
I will also be responsible for integrating a weather API to provide real-time weather updates for farmers. Weather plays a crucial role in pest outbreaks and crop health, so giving farmers access to timely weather information will help them make informed decisions about pest management and farming activities. I will also work on developing an advisory system that provides farmers with essential information about different pests and diseases. This feature will educate farmers on how to identify, prevent, and manage common agricultural threats, ensuring they are well-prepared to handle challenges before they escalate. By combining weather insights with expert advice, this system will empower farmers with the knowledge needed to protect their crops and improve yields.

<p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
I will be actively involved in developing the community section of the mobile application, working alongside other team members to ensure it serves as an interactive and valuable space for farmers. This section will provide a platform for farmers to share their experiences, ask questions, and receive guidance on managing Fall Armyworm (FAW) infestations effectively. Our goal is to create a user-friendly and engaging community where farmers can exchange knowledge, discuss best practices, and stay updated on the latest pest management strategies. By integrating technology with community-driven solutions, we aim to empower farmers with real-time support and collective learning to combat FAW more efficiently.

<h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Model Training</h3>
<p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
I will be actively involved in training the machine learning model used in the mobile application to detect Fall Armyworm (FAW) infestations. Leveraging my expertise in Python and machine learning, I will work on developing and fine-tuning the model to accurately identify FAW symptoms in crop images. By training the model on a diverse dataset of FAW images and healthy crops, I aim to create a robust and reliable detection system that can differentiate between infested and healthy plants. This model will serve as the core technology behind our pest diagnosis feature, providing farmers with instant feedback on pest presence and severity. Through continuous training and validation, I will ensure that the model delivers accurate results and meets the project's objectives of early detection and prevention of FAW outbreaks.

    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
I will be working on the treatment section of the mobile app, which will be displayed to farmers after diagnosing a Fall Armyworm (FAW) infestation. This section will provide users with tailored, easy-to-understand recommendations on how to effectively treat and manage the pest, based on the diagnosis results. Working alongside the team, I'll ensure that the treatment options provided are not only scientifically accurate but also practical and accessible for farmers. This feature aims to empower farmers by offering actionable solutions that can help them mitigate the damage caused by FAW and ultimately improve their crop yields. Our objective is to make sure that farmers receive reliable and timely advice to help them take the right steps in protecting their crops.

I will highlight the importance of developing a mobile application for Fall Armyworm (FAW) diagnosis and emphasize the need for accurate and accessible pest detection tools for farmers. The system overview section will outline the key features and functionalities of the application, including pest diagnosis, weather updates, and community engagement. I will describe how these components will work together to provide a comprehensive solution for FAW management. In the component design section, I will detail the architecture and design of each module, explaining how they will interact and contribute to the overall system. By documenting these aspects, I will ensure that the software design document accurately captures the project's scope, requirements, and technical specifications.
